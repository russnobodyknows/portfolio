Python is becoming more popular because more schools are teaching python rather than javascript every year, and it is also becoming more popular because it is easier to use than javascript when learning to program for the first time, according to Google Trends. Java script has been around for 25 years, but it is still one of the most important programming languages in use today.</p>

They developed JavaScript as a scripting language for use with Netscape Navigator, the company's flagship web browser, and for use with other web browsers as well. Because Netscape owns the trademark for "JavaScript," when it was integrated into Internet Explorer, it had to be referred to as "JScript" in order to avoid confusion.</p>
